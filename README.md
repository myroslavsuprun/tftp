# TFTP Project

This project implements a basic TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server and associated utilities in Node.js.

TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol defined in RFC 1350. It uses UDP as its transport protocol, providing a minimalistic and lightweight mechanism for file transfer, typically used in environments where simplicity is preferred over advanced features.

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`

2. Start the server in development mode:
   `npm run start:dev`

### Running Tests

Run tests using:
   `npm test`
